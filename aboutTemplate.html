<p class="info">Hi :) I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer from <span ng-style="{'color': listColor}">New York City</span>! I started teaching myself to code in 2017, and I landed my first job at Fiserv in January of 2023. I started with HTML, CSS, and Javascript but this year I have been focusing on getting up to speed with the back-end. So far this year I have gotten experience with many technologies and frameworks including React, AngularJS, SQL, Jest, Express, Sequelize, SQlite3, Node.Js, and Java and I am really enjoying the challenge. In my role at Fiserv I am using AngularJS, Spring Boot and Bootstrap. Although I love doing front-end, I am focusing on learning as much as I can right now to become a well rounded engineer.</p>
