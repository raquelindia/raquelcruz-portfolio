    <div class="center-content"><h4 class="sections-titles">Approach</h4></div>
    <div class="center-content"><p class="approach-desc">I worked on this project with another apprentice that is on the same 
                team as me, so we both use AngularJS regularly. We split the work up by pages. 
                We tried to recreate the Chase website exactly, so we used Chrome DevTools to check the values of the colors on the real Chase website. For the icons we used Google Material Icons. I made arrays in the 
                controller that had sample data that we could use for the components that are personalized for the user.</p></div>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <div class="center-content"><h5 class="approach-subheadings">Steps Taken</h5></div>
                    <div class="center-content"><p class="steps-desc">The first thing we did in this project was look at the actual Chase bank website to see which features we wanted to recreate. We agreed
                        that it would take way too much time to try to recreate everything, so we picked the main pages that are in the nav bar to work on and we didn't do any of the nested links. We divided the work evenly, so we both had two
                        pages to start with. For obvious reasons, we did not create wireframes for this project, but I did spend a good amount of 
                        time writing down all the hexcodes for the colors we needed to use and figuring out how to create the icons I couldn't find online. I started with the Accounts page and then all the other pages after 
                        that were easy because all the styling is consistent throughout the pages we picked. For the search function, I created an array of links to different parts of the website. A user can search and the links come up in a list.
                    </p></div>

                <div>
                    <div class="center-content"><h5 class="approach-subheadings">Challenges</h5></div>
                    <div class="center-content"><p class="challenges-desc">Something that was challenging about this project was keeping everything uniform. 
                        It was easy to divide the work up because there was only me and one other person working on this, but we didn't talk about stuff like the icons before 
                        before we started, so at one point our project had the same icons that looked similar, but were just slightly off and it looked weird.
                        Another blocker we had was the styling, particularly the margins. CSS is like a puzzle, and being that we couldn't work on this together every single time, we had to debug the CSS often. 
                        I had a lot of issues getting the body of each page to line up with the nav bar.
