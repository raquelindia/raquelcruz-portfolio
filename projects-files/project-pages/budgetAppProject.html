        was to create a frontend project with components that saves the state of some things.
        This is a project that is supposed to be related to my role at Fiserv, so my manager suggested a budgeting tool like Mint.

    <div class="center-content"><h4 class="sections-titles">Approach</h4></div>
    <div class="center-content"><p class="approach-desc">I decided to user AngularJS for this project because I use it everyday and I thought it would be good practice.
        Also, the testing framework usually used with AngularJS is Jasmine, and I have used Jasmine before so I already know how it works. AngularJS has directives so I used that for the components. 
        I have a form on the budgets page and the subscriptions page to create new budgets and subscriptions. I also have a form to edit budgets.
         In the Overview section, The number that you see at the top of the page is a sum of all the money thats been logged. I created sample data in the controller to test it out while I was making it.
        The budgets section has components that show how much of your budget you've spent or if you are exceeding it. There is a bar in each one that changes colors from grey to green and then orange and red depending on how much you've spent. 
        I shows you how much of your budget is left to spend. The subscriptions section shows which services you are currently subscribed to and how much they cost. Being that I used AngularJS and not React for this project,
        I did not use Redux, instead I used the AngularJs $cookies service. The budgets a user creates and the subscriptions they add to the list are saved in the browser cookies.

        <div class="center-content"><h5 class="approach-subheadings">Steps Taken</h5></div>
        <div class="center-content"><p class="steps-desc">This project took me 2 months to finish. The first thing I did in this project was figure out what features I wanted it to have.
             I looked for examples of apps that already existed like this one. The Mint app is very similar and it has a tab for an overview, budgets,
            subscriptions, and a place to view your account. I didn't include a section to create an account because I didn't feel like I had enough time
            to do that and meet all the criteria of the project. I started with the budgets section. For the sake of time, I didn't start this project using a database. I created arrays in the controller with 
            data that I could use in the components while I did the styling and added functionality. The main function of the app is to show how much money you have spent, how much you have left, etc. so I needed something there to make sure the functions I
            created for these things were working. After I did the styling and got everything looking how I wanted, I made sure the forms worked correctly and then I created a directive for the budgets section. For each budget 
            there is a box with the name of the budget, a bar that represents how much money was spent, a number that shows how much money is left and a button to delete that budget. 
            After that I created a test for the directive using Jasmine. I have used Jasmine before, but I had never used it with Karma, which is a framework for Jasmine. The information I found online about using Jasmine with AngularJS says that you should use it with Karma 
            because there is an easy way to test directives with it. For the life of me, I could not get it to work, and I was spending a lot of time trying, so I used Jasmine by itself. I ended up creating a test that adds two numbers to test if the test itself was working 
            and then I tested some of the functions that I used for the form submission. After that was working, I created a directive for the subscriptions component and it was basically the same process. The last page I added was a place to edit budgets.
            I ended up doing the routing near the end of everything because I was having trouble adding the cookies service and I had no way of checking to see if everything looked right on the UI after a form was submitted or deleted cause it wasnt saving the state. The last thing I did was set up
            the cookies. This app saves the state of the array of budget forms, subscription forms and the variables that have values of the totals of everything and percentages of things and stuff like the most expensive budget or subscription.

        <div class="center-content"><h5 class="approach-subheadings">Challenges</h5></div>
        <div class="center-content"><p class="challenges-desc">One thing I found challenging about this project was getting the directives working. I don't remember any errors showing up, and if there were they were not very informative, so it was hard to 
            figure out what I was doing wrong. Another thing I did not anticipate was issues using different CSS frameworks along with AngularJS styling features. I used regular 
            CSS, Tailwind, SASS, and the AngularJS ng-style directive. There were times where styles I was using weren't working as I expected and it was because the frameworks were conflicting with each other.
            The biggest issue I had with this project was checking if my directives were working. In an AngularJS app, it does not save any data entered from a form when you click on another link, So I was able to add a budget to the list but I couldn't see it in the list when
            I exited the form. At this point, it was almost time for me to submit the project, so I just made the form like a pop-up just to make it functional. I put the file that the form was in and the file the list of budgets was in on the same page using ng-include and then I changed which file was 
            being displayed based on the value of a variable that would change on the click of the button that opens the forms. Another thing that was challenging was working with nested files. I had to find ways to work around some of the files not being in the same scope as some of the data in the controller.

    <div class="center-content"><h5 class="approach-subheadings">Summary</h5></div>
    <div class="center-content"><p class="summary-desc">
        I learned a lot from this project. I have two directives, forms and the cookies services, which are all things I had very little experience with 
        before I did this. One thing I realized while I was working on this was that I didn't entirely understand how AngularJS variables work. Particularly, the scope of the variables.
         There was some unexpected behavior when I started nesting the files using ng-include. Overall, 
         I feel like I have a better understanding of how websites work in general after working on this. I had to create a lot of functions for the
         components to work correctly like finding the most expensive subscription or how much money is left for the user to spend. It was helpful to get experience doing all of it on my own.
