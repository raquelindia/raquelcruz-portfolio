    <div class="center-content"><p class="approach-desc">For this project I tried to create something that looks similar to the Apple 
        Weather App. I thought the idea of a weather app would be cool but I also am really interested in space I used NASAs Curiosity Rover API. I used AngularJS, and Tailwind. 
        I also used Google Material Icons because on the Apple weather app there are icons next to the titles of the sections.

            <div class="center-content"><h5 class="approach-subheadings">Steps Taken</h5></div>
            <div class="center-content"><p class="steps-desc">I finished this project in a couple days but I've still been adding to it because I want there to be more features. The first thing I did when I started this project was find the right API to use. NASA has two APIs for Mars weather 
                and one of them updates more frequently than the other. Once I got an API I could use, I created global variables to hold the data from the API that I knew I was going to use.
                I needed a lot more information to display the weather for the current day or latest weather, and then for the previous seven days section, I just included the dates, atmosphere, highs and lows.
                For the latest update I included the UV index, the time of the sunrise and sunset and the last section is the latest pictures taken from the rovers on Mars.
                For the background, I thought it would be cool to have something that moves. The Apple weather app background reflects the time of day and has CSS animations so I did the same thing.
                I used Tailwind for some parts but there were some parts that made more sense to use regular CSS. There is no routing for this app but I did use the cookies service to save the users preference for
                temperature. If you click the F or C buttons it switches between fahrenheit and celsius.

            <div class="center-content"><h5 class="approach-subheadings">Challenges</h5></div>
            <div class="center-content"><p class="challenges-desc">The biggest challenge doing this project was working with the API. NASA set a limit fot the number of requests per hour for all the APIs they have, 
                so there were times it was difficult to test everything without going over the limit. I think even console logging certain things
                would mess it up sometimes. I also had to limit the number of photos I was getting for the Mars Rover Photos section because there were thousands of photos coming from the API.

    <div class="center-content"><h5 class="approach-subheadings">Summary</h5></div>
    <div class="center-content"><p class="summary-desc">
     I think doing this project was good practice for some of the front end concepts that were confusing to me before.
      I didn't have to really learn anything new for this project but the API I used was a little complicated and I am glad I got experience 
      using one that isn't straightforward and has multiple nested arrays of objects. I also learned an easier way to do animated backgrounds with AngularJS.
      When I started working on this, I used a video for the background and i was having a hard time getting it positioned correctly and it was also making the page slower
      to load. I ended up creating the background in a seperate HTML file using animations and including it in the index.html file and then giving it a negative z-index.
