                My API checks the SQLite3 database for an email that matches the one you logged in with and displays your profile information and will only allow you to see entries associated with that email.</p></div>

                    <div class="center-content"><h5 class="approach-subheadings">Steps Taken</h5></div>
                    <div class="center-content"><p class="steps-desc">I started this project by looking for examples of other APIs and looking at the work we had done in the weeks prior, because even though we spent a few weeks learning about them, I still felt 
                        like I didn't understand all the things that go into creating one. I don't think I had any examples of my own that worked completely. All the little projects we had done with APIs, I could only get to 'kind of' work. 
                        I started with doing the parts that I was confident that I could do correctly. I picked journal entries for my API because I didn't want to overcomplicate things knowing I really 
                        didn't know what I was doing yet. The first thing I did was create the Sequelize models because I knew what I would need to include in them, and then I started working on the database. I think I had used the wrong database at first and I had to start over a few times. I created a file with seed data 
                        and then started working on seeding the database. After that I started with the routes. I tested themwith Postman and then I added Auth0 right after. After I was done with everything I tested the 
                        Sequelize models using Jest.

                <div class="center-content"><p class="challenges-desc">I struggled with this project because I did everything on my own, so I spent a lot of time troubleshooting.
                    Getting Auth0 set up was tricky and it took up the majority of the time I spent working on this. Another thing that was a challenge for me was getting the SQLite3 database set up. My database either kept dropping the tables or
                    duplicating everything over and over. This is something I struggled with for a while. I had to find examples of similar projects to reference to figure out how to make it work the way I intended.
                    Auth0 took a while for me to set up as well and was more difficult than I expected.

            <div class="center-content"><h5 class="approach-subheadings">Summary</h5></div>
            <div class="center-content"><p class="summary-desc">
               I think out of all the projects I've done for Multiverse, this one was the msot challenging but, I definitely learned the most 
               from this one. I have been doing little front end projects since I coding, this was the first time I did anything like this without help. 
               I need more practice creating my own APIs because somethings are still confusing to me, but I am confident that I am at least able to figure it out if I need to.
                One thing I can improve on is doing the UI and the API. The API and login works but the UI doesn't have any styling or anything. I started to do the UI but I couldn't get it to work and I didn't want
                to break anything in the process.
