                My API checks the SQLite3 database for an email that matches the one you logged in with and displays your profile information and will only allow you to see entries associated with that email.</p></div>

                    <div class="center-content"><p class="steps-desc">I started this project by looking for examples of other APIs and looking at the work we had done in the weeks prior, because even though we spent a few weeks learning about them, I still felt 
                        like I didn't understand all the things that go into creating one. I don't think I had any examples of my own that worked completely. All the little projects we had done with APIs, I could only get to 'kind of' work. 
                        I started with doing the parts that I was confident that I could do correctly. I picked journal entries for my API because I didn't want to overcomplicate things knowing I really 
                        didn't know what I was doing yet. The first thing I did was create the Sequelize models and then I started working on the database. I think I had used the wrong database at first and I had to start over a few times. I created a file with seed data 
                        and then started working on seeding the database. At one point I had gotten it working and then somehow it dropped all the data. There was another point where it kept duplicating everything in the database. 
                        I had a hard time getting Auth0 working, but seeding the database was definitely the most excruciating part of the project.

                <div class="center-content"><h5 class="approach-subheadings">Challenges</h5></div>
                <div class="center-content"><p class="challenges-desc">I struggled with this project because I did everything on my own, so I spent a lot of time troubleshooting.
                    Getting Auth0 set up was tricky and it took up the majority of the time I spent working on this. Another thing that was a challenge for me was getting the database set up. 
                    For a while I was having trouble seeding the database. I had to find examples of similar projects to reference to figure out how to make it work the way I intended.
