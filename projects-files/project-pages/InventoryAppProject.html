                <div class="center-content"><p class="steps-desc">This project took us 4 weeks to finish. The first thing we did was choose a color scheme. I found one on google that everyone liked, so we went with that one and then I created the wireframes. 
                    This wasn't a very complicated project, We used stock images for the items and put a form on each individual page to edit or delete an item and then we used Render to deploy it.

                <div class="center-content"><p class="challenges-desc">The only challenge for me during this project was working with React. We did this project at the the beginning of the 
                    apprenticeship and we had not done anything with React yet, so I did most of the CSS. I did have to get familiar with React a little because the way we were using CSS with it was different than what I was used 
                    to seeing.</p></div>

            <div class="center-content"><p class="summary-desc">
                Something I learned while working on this project was CSS works differently with different frameworks. I think this  was the first 
                group project we did during the Multiverse bootcamp and there were a lot of concepts that were still very new to me. Having to use "className"
                 instead of classes was confusing at first especially since I had never used React prior to this. Overall, I learned a lot from working on this, mostly from 
                 the people I was working with.
